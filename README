This is a set of tools specifically designed to process Tstat log files.
When possible, they rely on multiprocessing library to speed up processing.
Tools:

1) regexp_filter.py - 	It apply a filter based on a regular expression on 
						a given column, and outputs selected column only.
2) get-organization-records.py - 	Given an organization name as input, it
						rely on MaxMind database to processes Tstat logs and 
						filter out unrelated records. It also implements the 
						HTTP-knocking and reverse lookup techniques to 
						retrieve information about hosted services
3) time-series.py -		It provides an aggregated time series computed over
						a specific column and a given time granularity
4) quantile.py - 		It provides all quantiles (or percentiles) from 1 to 
						99 of a empyrical distribition.
